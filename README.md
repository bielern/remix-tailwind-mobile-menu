# Example for responsive mobile menu using react, remix and tailwind

This example uses [react](https://reactjs.org), [remix](https://remix.run) and 
[tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to create a menu that changes responsively 
when going from a large screen to a small mobile phone screen 
(with a burger menu).

* Menu Wide

* Menu Small Closed

```sh
npm run build
